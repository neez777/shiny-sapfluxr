# SweetAlert Notifications Fix

## The Real Problem

**Shiny's `showNotification()` has inconsistent auto-dismiss behavior**, especially:
- In browser mode (vs RStudio Viewer)
- In modules
- Across different Shiny versions

## The Solution: SweetAlert2

Switched to **shinyWidgets::sendSweetAlert()** which uses SweetAlert2 - a modern, reliable notification library that:
- ✅ Actually auto-dismisses with timer
- ✅ Works consistently in all browsers
- ✅ Better visual design
- ✅ More customization options

---

## What Changed

### Before (Unreliable):
```r
showNotification(
  "Success!",
  type = "message",
  duration = 5,
  session = session
)
```
**Problem:** Sometimes auto-closes, sometimes doesn't, especially in browser mode.

### After (Reliable):
```r
shinyWidgets::sendSweetAlert(
  session = session,
  title = "Success!",
  text = "Operation completed",
  type = "success",
  timer = 3000  # Auto-close after 3 seconds
)
```
**Works every time!**

## Files Updated

1. **R/notify_helper.R** (NEW)
   - Helper functions for consistent notifications
   - `notify_success()`, `notify_error()`, `notify_warning()`, `notify_info()`
   - `notify_progress()`, `close_notify()`

2. **R/mod_methods.R**
   - All notifications converted to SweetAlert
   - Progress indicator using `show_alert()`
   - Auto-closes after 3 seconds for success

3. **R/mod_data_upload.R**
   - File upload success/error notifications
   - Auto-closes after 3 seconds

4. **R/mod_clock_drift.R**
   - Clock drift correction notifications
   - Auto-closes after 3 seconds

5. **app.R**
   - Sources notify_helper.R

## Notification Types

### Success (Auto-close after 3 seconds)
```r
shinyWidgets::sendSweetAlert(
  session = session,
  title = "Success!",
  text = "Calculation complete!",
  type = "success",
  timer = 3000
)
```

### Error (Stays until user clicks OK)
```r
shinyWidgets::sendSweetAlert(
  session = session,
  title = "Error",
  text = error_message,
  type = "error"
  # No timer = stays open
)
```

### Warning (Auto-close after 3 seconds)
```r
shinyWidgets::sendSweetAlert(
  session = session,
  title = "Warning",
  text = "Please check your selection",
  type = "warning",
  timer = 3000
)
```

### Progress (No buttons, stays open)
```r
shinyWidgets::show_alert(
  title = "Processing...",
  text = "This may take several minutes",
  type = "info",
  showConfirmButton = FALSE,
  timer = NULL
)

# Later, close it:
shinyWidgets::closeSweetAlert(session = session)
```

## Progress Indicator Changes

### Before:
- Tried to use progressr with console handler (doesn't work in browser)
- Tried waiter package (works but no progress details)

### After:
- Simple "Calculating..." alert appears when you click Calculate
- Alert stays visible during calculation
- Alert closes when calculation completes
- Success message shows with result count
- **Simple, clear, works in browser!**

### Why No Progress Bar?

sapfluxr's internal progress reporting is designed for console output. To show a real progress bar in Shiny would require:
1. Modifying sapfluxr to return progress updates
2. Complex Shiny async operations
3. Much more complicated code

**Current approach is simpler and more reliable:**
- User clicks "Calculate"
- "Calculating..." alert appears immediately
- User knows something is happening
- Alert disappears when done
- Success/error message shows result

For large datasets (several minutes), the user clearly sees the alert and knows the app is working.
