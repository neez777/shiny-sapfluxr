# All Issues Resolved - Session 4 Complete

## Summary

All major issues from Session 4 visualization have been resolved:

âœ… **Time series plot "subscript out of bounds" error** - FIXED
âœ… **Range slider not working** - FIXED
âœ… **Blue toast notifications persisting** - FIXED
âœ… **Progress bar added** - COMPLETE
âœ… **sDMA multi-select** - COMPLETE

---

## Issue 1: Time Series Plot Error âœ… FIXED

### Problem:
```
Error: subscript out of bounds
```

### Root Cause:
Quality flag markers tried to access shapes/colors for unknown flags using `[[flag]]` subsetting, which failed if the flag wasn't in the predefined list.

### Solution:
Added safe access with defaults in `R/mod_plot_timeseries.R` lines 369-380:

```r
# Get shape and color safely - use defaults if not defined
flag_shape <- if (flag %in% names(flag_shapes)) {
  flag_shapes[[flag]]
} else {
  "circle"  # Default shape for unknown flags
}

flag_color <- if (flag %in% names(flag_colours)) {
  flag_colours[[flag]]
} else {
  "#999999"  # Default gray for unknown flags
}
```

**Result:** Plot handles any quality flags sapfluxr returns, even unknown ones.

## Issue 2: Range Slider Not Working âœ… FIXED

### Problem:
The range slider (small plot below main plot for timescale adjustment) wasn't displaying properly.

### Solution:
Configured range slider with proper thickness and increased bottom margin in `R/mod_plot_timeseries.R`:

```r
xaxis = list(
  rangeslider = list(
    visible = TRUE,
    thickness = 0.1  # 10% of plot height
  )
),
margin = list(b = 150)  # Increased from 100 for slider space
```

**Result:** Range slider displays properly with date selector buttons (1d, 1w, 1m, 3m, All).

---

## Issue 3: Blue Toast Notifications âœ… FIXED

### Problem:
Light blue toast notifications (Shiny's `showNotification()`) appearing in bottom-right corner and not auto-dismissing.

### Root Cause:
1. progressr package using Shiny notification system
2. Leftover progressr usage in data upload module

### Solutions:

**A. Disabled progressr in `app.R`:**
```r
# Disable progressr handlers to prevent blue toast notifications
if (requireNamespace("progressr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  progressr::handlers("void")
}
```

**B. Removed progressr from data upload module:**
Replaced `progressr::with_progress()` with SweetAlert loading notification in `R/mod_data_upload.R`:

```r
# Show loading notification
shinyWidgets::sendSweetAlert(
  session = session,
  title = "Loading File...",
  text = "Please wait while your data is being imported and validated.",
  type = "info",
  showConfirmButton = FALSE
)

# Read data
data <- sapfluxr::read_heat_pulse_data(input$file$datapath)

# Close loading notification
shinyWidgets::closeSweetAlert(session = session)
```

**Result:** All notifications now use SweetAlert exclusively - no more blue toasts!

---

## Issue 4: Progress Bar for Calculations âœ… COMPLETE

### Requirement:
Show visual progress during heat pulse velocity calculations.

### Implementation:
Added `progressSweetAlert()` in `R/mod_methods.R` with stage-based updates:

```r
# Start progress
shinyWidgets::progressSweetAlert(
  session = session,
  id = "calc_progress",
  title = "Calculating Heat Pulse Velocities",
  display_pct = TRUE,
  value = 0
)

# After main calculation
shinyWidgets::updateProgressBar(
  session = session,
  id = "calc_progress",
  value = 80,
  title = "Processing Results..."
)

# If sDMA enabled
shinyWidgets::updateProgressBar(
  session = session,
  id = "calc_progress",
  value = 85,
  title = "Applying sDMA Processing..."
)

# Complete
shinyWidgets::updateProgressBar(
  session = session,
  id = "calc_progress",
  value = 100,
  title = "Complete!"
)

Sys.sleep(0.5)  # Brief pause to show 100%
shinyWidgets::closeSweetAlert(session = session)
```

**Progress Stages:**
- 0% â†’ Calculating (during sapfluxr processing)
- 80% â†’ Processing results
- 85% â†’ Applying sDMA (if enabled)
- 100% â†’ Complete! (shows briefly before closing)

**Result:** Users see clear visual feedback during calculations with meaningful stage updates.

---

## Issue 5: sDMA Multi-Select âœ… COMPLETE

### Problem:
Could only select one secondary method for sDMA processing.

### Solution:
Changed from `selectInput` to `checkboxGroupInput` in `R/mod_methods.R`:

```r
# BEFORE - single select:
selectInput(
  ns("sdma_secondary"),
  "Secondary Method for sDMA:",
  choices = c(...)
)

# AFTER - multi-select:
checkboxGroupInput(
  ns("sdma_secondary"),
  "Secondary Methods for sDMA:",
  choices = c(
    "MHR" = "MHR",
    "Tmax (Cohen)" = "Tmax_Coh",
    "Tmax (Kluitenberg)" = "Tmax_Klu",
    "HRMXa" = "HRMXa",
    "HRMXb" = "HRMXb"
  ),
  selected = "MHR"
)
```

**Result:** Users can select multiple secondary methods for sDMA comparison.

## Session 4 Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All requirements from Session 4 visualization have been implemented:

âœ… Interactive plotly time series visualization
âœ… Method selection controls

âœ… Quality flag markers
âœ… Range slider for timescale navigation
âœ… Zoom preservation when changing filters
âœ… Progress bar during calculations
âœ… All notifications via SweetAlert (no blue toasts)

- Session 6: Export functionality (plots, data, configurations)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always check error location carefully** - The subscript error was NOT in method colors (despite extensive debugging there) but in quality flag markers.

2. **progressr + Shiny = toast notifications** - When progressr handlers are enabled, they create Shiny notifications. Disabling with `handlers("void")` prevents this.

3. **Consistent notification system** - Using only SweetAlert (via shinyWidgets) ensures predictable, professional notifications that auto-dismiss properly.

4. **Stage-based progress** - For synchronous operations, showing meaningful stages (0% â†’ 80% â†’ 85% â†’ 100%) provides better UX than trying to show real-time progress.

5. **Safe subsetting** - Always check if keys exist before using `[[key]]` - provide sensible defaults for unknown cases.
