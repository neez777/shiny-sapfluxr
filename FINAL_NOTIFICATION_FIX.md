# Final Notification & Progress Bar Fix

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Replaced ALL Shiny Notifications** âœ“
Converted every remaining `showNotification()` call to SweetAlert using helper functions.

**Files Updated:**
- `R/mod_clock_drift.R` - 3 notifications replaced
- `R/mod_config.R` - 9 notifications replaced
- All modules now use SweetAlert consistently

### 2. **Added Real Progress Bar** âœ“
Calculations now show a **visual progress bar** that updates during processing.

---

## New Progress Bar Features

### What You'll See:

1. **Click "Calculate Heat Pulse Velocity"**
   - Progress bar appears immediately showing 0%
   - Title: "Calculating Heat Pulse Velocities"

2. **During Main Calculation**
   - Progress bar stays at 0% (sapfluxr is processing)
   - Title shows current step

3. **After Main Calculation Completes**
   - Progress jumps to 80%
   - Title: "Processing Results..."

4. **If sDMA is Enabled**
   - Progress updates to 85%
   - Title: "Applying sDMA Processing..."

5. **Completion**
   - Progress reaches 100%
   - Title: "Complete!"
   - Brief pause to show 100%
   - Progress bar closes
   - Success message appears (auto-closes after 3 seconds)

## Implementation Details

### Progress Bar Code:
```r
# Show progress bar
shinyWidgets::progressSweetAlert(
  session = session,
  id = "calc_progress",
  title = "Calculating Heat Pulse Velocities",
  display_pct = TRUE,
  value = 0
)

# Update as processing continues
shinyWidgets::updateProgressBar(
  session = session,
  id = "calc_progress",
  value = 80,
  title = "Processing Results..."
)

# Complete
shinyWidgets::updateProgressBar(
  session = session,
  id = "calc_progress",
  value = 100,
  title = "Complete!"
)

Sys.sleep(0.5)  # Brief pause to show 100%

# Close
shinyWidgets::closeSweetAlert(session = session)
```

## Why Progress Doesn't Show Real-Time Updates

The progress bar shows **stages** rather than real-time percentage because:

1. **sapfluxr's processing is synchronous** - R blocks until calculation completes
2. **progressr console output doesn't integrate** with Shiny progress bars
3. **True real-time progress** would require:
   - Asynchronous execution (futures/promises)
   - Modifying sapfluxr to report progress differently
   - Much more complex code

**Current approach is simpler and more reliable:**
- User sees progress bar immediately (knows app is working)
- Progress updates at logical stages (main calc â†’ results â†’ sDMA â†’ done)
- Clear titles show what's happening
- 100% completion gives positive feedback

For large datasets taking minutes, this provides clear visual feedback that the app is actively processing.

## All Notifications Now Use SweetAlert

### Success Messages (Auto-close after 3 seconds):
```r
notify_success(session, "Success!", "Operation completed")
```

### Error Messages (Stay until dismissed):
```r
notify_error(session, "Error Title", error_message)
```

### Warning Messages (Auto-close after 3 seconds):
```r
notify_warning(session, "Warning!", warning_message)
```

### Progress Messages (No buttons, stays open):
```r
notify_progress(
  title = "Processing...",
  text = "Please wait"
)

# Later:
close_notify(session)
```

## Benefits

âœ… **No more persistent toast notifications** - all auto-close properly
âœ… **Visual progress feedback** during calculations
âœ… **Professional appearance** with centered modal dialogs
âœ… **Consistent behavior** across all browsers
âœ… **Better UX** - users know what's happening at each stage

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload file - sweet alert appears and auto-closes âœ“
- [ ] Run calculation - progress bar shows with stages âœ“
- [ ] Progress bar reaches 100% before closing âœ“
- [ ] Success message appears after progress bar closes âœ“
- [ ] Success message auto-closes after 3 seconds âœ“
- [ ] Configuration changes show sweet alerts âœ“
- [ ] All sweet alerts auto-close (except errors) âœ“
- [ ] Error messages stay visible until dismissed âœ“

## What Happened to the Blue Toast Notifications?

Those were Shiny's `showNotification()` calls that we've now completely replaced with SweetAlert.

**Before:** Light blue toast in corner that sometimes wouldn't disappear
**After:** Centered modal dialog that reliably auto-closes

All notifications now use the same system (SweetAlert2 via shinyWidgets) for consistency.

---

## Summary

**Every notification in the app now uses SweetAlert and will auto-close properly!**

**Every calculation now shows a visual progress bar with stage updates!**

No more persistent blue toasts cluttering the screen! ðŸŽ‰
