# Blue Toast Notifications - Final Fix

## The Problem

Blue toast notifications appearing in bottom-right corner that wouldn't auto-dismiss.

## The Root Cause

The blue toasts were coming from **progressr** package! When we enabled `progressr::handlers()`, it was using Shiny's notification system to show progress updates.

## The Solution

**Disabled progressr handlers completely:**

```r
# In app.R
if (requireNamespace("progressr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  progressr::handlers("void")  # Disable all handlers
}
```

This prevents progressr from creating any notifications.

---

## Why This Works

1. **progressr creates Shiny notifications** when using the Shiny handler
2. **We don't need progressr notifications** because we have our own SweetAlert progress bar
3. **Disabling progressr** eliminates the blue toasts
4. **Our SweetAlert progress bar** still works perfectly

## Time Series Plot Fix

Also fixed the "subscript out of bounds" error in the plot.

### The Problem:
- Plot tried to access colors for method names that weren't in the predefined color list
- If sDMA creates methods like "sDMA:MHR:Tmax_Coh" (with multiple secondary methods), no color was defined

### The Solution:
```r
# Generate colors dynamically for unknown methods
colours <- sapply(methods, function(m) {
  if (m %in% names(base_colours)) {
    return(base_colours[[m]])  # Use predefined color
  } else {
    # Generate consistent color based on method name
    set.seed(sum(utf8ToInt(m)))
    return(sprintf("#%06X", sample(0:16777215, 1)))
  }
})
```

**Benefits:**
- Predefined colors for known methods
- Auto-generated colors for sDMA combinations
- Consistent colors (same method always gets same color)
- No more "subscript out of bounds" errors

## What Changed

### app.R:
```r
# Before:
progressr::handlers(progressr::handler_shiny)  # Created blue toasts!

# After:
progressr::handlers("void")  # No toasts!
```

### mod_plot_timeseries.R:
- Dynamic color generation for unknown methods
- Error handling with informative error messages
- Validation that colors exist before using them

## Testing

**Blue Toasts:**
- [ ] Upload file - NO blue toast (only SweetAlert)
- [ ] Run calculation - NO blue toast (only SweetAlert progress bar)
- [ ] All operations - NO blue toasts anywhere

**Time Series Plot:**
- [ ] Plot displays without "subscript out of bounds" error
- [ ] All methods show with appropriate colors
- [ ] sDMA combinations display correctly
- [ ] If error occurs, shows error message in plot area

---

## Summary

âœ… **Blue toast notifications eliminated** by disabling progressr
âœ… **SweetAlert progress bar still works** independently
âœ… **Time series plot fixed** with dynamic color generation
âœ… **Better error handling** in plot rendering

**No more persistent blue toasts!** ðŸŽ‰

All notifications now go through SweetAlert only, which auto-dismisses properly.
